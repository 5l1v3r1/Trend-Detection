Noise Study of FPSO Using 3D Acoustics Prediction Software














 


 COMPANY OVERVIEW

INTRODUCTION
 
The company started out in 1996 as ADZAAN Vibro-Acoustics, an engineering consulting firm specialising in noise and vibration. Over the years, we have taken incremental steps into other areas as we built up our capabilities and competencies. These areas include Fluid Dynamics and Environmental, Health and Safety solutions.
 
ADZAAN CONSULTING PTE LTD was formally registered in 2010. Although acoustics (sound) and vibration are our founding competencies and will remain so, the name ADZAAN CONSULTING was chosen to better reflect our expanded scope of services.
 
ADZAAN is an expansion of the Arabic root word UDZUN which means the ear. The ear is not only our primary sensor for detecting sound, but its construction and operating mechanism clearly demonstrate the inter-relatedness of sound and vibration.
 

A key ADZAAN philosophy is to provide value added engineering analysis for every job that we do, big or small. We believe that a careful and comprehensive analysis would in most cases lead to a better and more cost effective solution. We also believe in doing the job right, and thus incorporate a “work till resolved” clause in our proposals in appropriate situations.
 
These two key philosophies are encapsulated in our new tag line;
  “. . . . . Solutions Engineered Through Integrity”
 
VISION
 
Leading edge multi-disciplinary engineering firm serving the global market in partnership with locally based EPC clients and serving the regional and local markets via strong Internet presence and onsite capabilities
 
MISSION
 
To provide value added engineering services based on integrated multi-disciplinary approach
 
CORE VALUES
 

INTEGRITY in our dealings with all stakeholders
EXCELLENCE in what we do
RESPECT for all

 

 



 


 WHY JOIN US?

A challenging and fulfilling career in engineering consulting awaits the successful candidate at ADZAAN, where Solutions are Engineered through Integrity.
