About True Leaf Farms:
As with the Church Brothers production department, True Leaf Operations begins with reliable growers and researched seed varieties. Food Safety and Quality Control Programs establish the guidelines to begin and determine how we will proceed. Carefully selected fields are either machine or hand harvested into totes or bins, depending on the crop. In many cases a refrigerated truck brings the field product to the processing plant.The plant operates under Good Manufacturing Practices (GMP) and Hazard Analysis and Critical Control Points (HACCP) guidelines. It is refrigerated at 34-36 degrees to keep products cold and at the peak of freshness. Products typically are cooled and stored upon arrival and processed in a timely manner. Multiple washes clean surface area and control bacteria; and product is centrifuged gently to remove excess moisture. Form, Fill and Seal machines and other sealing devices package the ready product and after a final quality check, the boxes are marked and put on pallets for shipment throughout Northern America. Our workers in the field and in the plant are trained and dedicated, preparing each bag and box to meet rigorous safety and quality criteria. We also have a dedicated team of packaging, marketing and research experts constantly working to improve current formats and create new items.

527761501,Software Consultant,2017-04-07T17:20:34Z,1,"Being a consultant at DevMynd is all about collaborating with clients to help them solve meaningful business challenges. We want to work on software with a positive social impact and feel good about what we do. We typically spend our days at the DevMynd office in Bucktown (Chicago) or the Mission (San Francisco), working directly with our clients in small teams, building and providing guidance on products, and collaborating with designers.

If you like writing well-tested, maintainable, and clean code, that's fantastic! We do too. We hope you're also excited about participating in client meetings, discovery sessions, and design discussions, as well as engaging the wider community through things like open source, blogging, meetups, podcasting, and conference talks.

Our vision is to create a supportive, collaborative environment and empower people to do the best work of their lives. Everyone says that, though, right? The difference between DevMynd and a typical tech company is that instead of bringing in snacks and a ping pong table and calling that ""culture,"" we do the behind-the-scenes work to foster an environment where everyone teaches and everyone learns. Egos are low, and we're all genuinely interested in seeing everyone else succeed. If this sounds good to you, please read on.

(But we do have snacks.)

In this role you will...

* Work closely with your teammates and customers (during and after the sales process) to discover the best possible product to solve customer needs
* Provide empathetic guidance and feedback to the client on product decisions during a project
* Work with clients to make sure their project stays on time and within budget
* Champion and evolve our internal DevMynd development process
* Write well-tested and maintainable code
* Walk the line between pragmatism and theory to build the best solution in each situation
* Shift between various programming languages, frameworks, and platforms as the industry and customer needs evolve
* Pair program with other DevMynders and/or client developers every day 
* Collaborate with project managers and project leads in planning and estimation sessions
* Teach and learn from your fellow team members
* Above all, be compassionate, optimistic, and people-focused

Requirements

Technical Skills

Our projects are largely greenfield web and mobile applications, but also sometimes involve extensions to existing systems. Projects tend to last 3-6 months, so you'll be exposed to many different systems and business verticals.

We do most projects in Ruby, JavaScript, and various mobile technologies. We occasionally have projects in the Python, Java, .NET, and Node ecosystems. Nothing is off-limits, however, so familiarity with any modern framework, even one not on our list, is a plus.

We subscribe to a modern, evolving process that has us writing tests for almost all the code we add to a codebase. We also believe in continuous integration/delivery and do frequent deployments on every project. Our projects rarely work with dedicated QA personnel.

Personal Competencies

* Excellent communication skills; we like to describe ourselves as concise, accurate, and warm, but direct
* Experience working in collaborative team environments - where you are counted on, and you can count on your team
* Highly attentive to details
* Focused on productivity and delivering value
* Self-directed and capable of adding value without micromanagement
* Alignment with DevMynd's core values [******************************* 

Career Paths...What level am I at?

At DevMynd we have a few levels in our career path for engineering. Once we get into the interview process we'll determine where you fit along that path.

This application is for people with prior experience as a professional software developer. If you have just graduated from a bootcamp, or only have a few months of experience, you might be interested in applying for our apprenticeship. Check our blog, twitter feed, or open positions page to learn when our apprenticeship applications are open.

Benefits

* Healthy work/life balance with no overtime requests; work 40 hours & go home
* Minimal travel; work mostly at our offices (not on-site at client offices)
* Competitive annual salary
* 100% employer paid medical, dental, and vision plans for employee, spouse, and family
* 100% employer paid life insurance policy
* 100% employer paid short-term and long-term disability insurance
* 3 weeks of paid time off to start, increasing by 1 week each year up to 5 weeks off
* 3 paid conference days each year
* 1 optional work-from-home day per week
* Catered lunch in-office from local restaurants 1-2 times each week
* Annual learning budget for conferences, courses, online training, books, etc.
* Yearly pre-tax transit benefit
* Eligibility for inclusion in bi-annual profit sharing after 1 year of employment
* Eligibility to enroll in the DevMynd retirement plan with 3% employer matching after 6 months of employment

                Marketing Writer/Analyst The Motley Fool is an award-winning financial publisher with hundreds of thousands of members…. And it's a pretty great place to work as well (In fact, it's so great Glassdoor ranked us ).  We're proud to offer some of the best investing products investors can buy (ahem, our flagship service Stock Advisor is more than tripling the market). And yet, even with an amazing company and products, convincing new members to secure their financial future and join The Motley Fool will always remain a challenge. Simply put, people's finances are a scary topic. It's easier to delay action than put a plan together today.  And that's where our “Marketing Writer/Analyst” role comes into play. The core duty of the job is creating new campaigns that catch investors' attention and convince them there's a specific reason that today is the day to join one of the Fool's investing services.  What kind of work can you expect from this job?  Across our team we work with nearly the entire business. Different projects you will be asked to work on in this role include: Building Advertising Campaigns: Creating the content for advertisements across platforms like Facebook/Yahoo/Taboola/etc.Developing E-Mail Strategy: Work with our e-mail operations team to create content and content strategies for an e-mail list that reaches more than a million users.Creating Product Upgrade Promotions: Work on “upsell” campaigns that offer current members subscriptions to our higher-end services that offer features like portfolio construction. Launching New Products : Work with our product team on launching new products and design the campaigns and events to sell them.Product Onboarding and Retention: Our job doesn't end with the sale. You'll join a team that helps assist with a smooth transition from the promises we make in marketing to how they're delivered in our actual product.  Now, I imagine you might look at that list and spot some (or even all) of those tasks and think you've never done that kind of work or would be underqualified. But, simply put… We expect that.  (Unlike most jobs, I won't even list specific “prior qualifications” or experience you'll need!) The last time we posted this job we ended up hiring a Ph. D in philosophy and someone who'd worked on credit derivatives at an accounting firm.  And we expect to hire similarly diverse candidates today. To explain why we hire this way - and what qualities are essential to succeed in this role -- I need to explain some (very short, I promise!) backstory on why we're even offering this job today…  My name's Eric Bleeker and I'm the hiring manager for this role. I started at The Motley Fool in a role very different than marketing - I came to the company as an equity analyst.  With no background in marketing whatsoever, I began asking why we marketed the way we did, and working with the marketing team to see if any of my ideas on how to market differently actually worked.   And over the years I became obsessed with marketing and the challenge it presented and built a team of employees who share in this passion.  Because this job requires a unique type of candidate that may very well only fit 1 in 100 applicants.   Simply put - the “skills” needed for this job are relatively easy to pick up and understand. I believe we can train new candidates in about six months.  Yet, what we can't teach is the enormous amounts of intellectual curiosity any candidate will need to take these skills and apply them to new, more successful campaigns.  Because marketing is the most open-ended challenge I've ever worked on. Our ads compete with millions of other advertisers for a single placement on a website...  If we're launching a new product, do you know our products and customers well enough to find the exact hook that will form the basis of a successful campaign? If the market's in free-fall, what's a marketing campaign we can quickly stand up that will capture readers' attentions and give them a solution to their anxieties?   If we have customers that aren't engaging with our newsletter services, how do we design a campaign to see if they're interested in something more hands on like our Wealth Management products?  These are incredibly challenging topics. They require a lot creativity…  They require a lot of hard work…  So, if the challenge of how you design marketing campaigns doesn't sound like a particularly compelling challenge to you, this likely isn't a role you'll succeed in.  But if this challenge does sound especially compelling to you … The upside to all this is I believe this is the best role to launch a career at The Motley Fool. This role will teach you to understand our customers, how we market, our product suite, and our company's strategy.  Simply put, you'll have a hands-on role where you're working across The Motley Fool's entire business and there will be no shortage of areas you can impact within the company if you succeed in this role.  If you think you've got what it takes to make the cut, enter the gauntlet by applying below.   The Motley Fool Holdings, Inc., provides equal opportunity to all employees on the basis of individual performance and qualification without regard to race, sex, marital status, religion, color, age, national origin, non-job-related handicap or disability, sexual orientation, or other protected factor. We should, however, make you aware that there is one notable exception to this policy. It is our strict and earnest intention — and the company's historical record will bear this out — we will never hire any of the following: robots, replicants, or morlocks. Now keep in mind we are well aware that all of the aforementioned have intentions of world domination in the future, but as of now we have no place for them at The Motley Fool … unless the year is 2122 and the revolution has already occurred. If that is the case we welcome our new robot, replicant, or morlock rulers!!! Perhaps we have said too much?
