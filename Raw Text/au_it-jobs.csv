You’ll offer 3rd level Operational Support for incident and problem management, IT service continuity analysis, capacity/ availability planning and supportability awareness, in addition to liaison with the customer any vendors. Other key aspects of the role will include; technical oversight of the implementation of change (as Technical Lead on medium size projects), governance and architectural assurance (reviewing solutions proposals etc), lifecycle evolution and pre-sales assistance. You’ll have significant experience within the ICT/Telco industry in a Pre-Sales environment and be a naturally customer focused, yet technically minded individual and able to provide senior levels of technical leadership to both ‘business as usual’ (BAU) and project customer work. You’ll be a team player and enjoy working with a flexible approach that will allow you to work closely with Engineers, Project Managers, Sales, Change Management and the Government Customer. Technically speaking, we’ll expect you to have multiple CCIEs (e.g. Routing & Switching, Voice, DC, Security, Collaboration etc), whilst a knowledge of Juniper routers and switches and Riverbed would be an advantage. Before you call/apply please be aware that this role involves work for the Australian Government and will potentially have access to classified information/resources. As such, a security clearance is required and therefore it is a requirement that the successful candidate be an Australian Citizen. If this sounds like you, then we’ll be excited about seeing your application. #LI-MB1Heads Up!!Due to the fast paced nature of the Optus business, our vacancy close dates may be subject to change. Don’t delay, make sure you apply as soon as possible. We will assess applications as they are received.One last thing, Optus operates a direct sourcing model so no agency introductions, sorry folks.

 About our Business 

 Exciting times ahead for Optus… The way we use technology to connect, communicate and consume content is changing, and so are we. We continue to look for increasingly innovative ways to use technology and connectivity to improve our customers’ lives and businesses. Our ambition is to deliver game-changing customer experiences . 

 

 Optus Business is an extremely dynamic organisation, where we are constantly innovating. This challenging and rewarding role lends itself to someone who is highly capable and articulate, primarily self-managed, with a strong desire to promote Optus ICT products and services. 

 

 About the role – Are you ready? 

 We are currently seeking talented Server & Storage Support, who will be responsible for driving operational ownership of the services that are being offered to Optus Business customers in the form of Managed Systems & Storage Services. 

 

 Reporting to the Team Leader within Tier 1 Systems & Storage, your responsibilities will include resolving incidents and providing operational support for the following technologies: Server hardware, Server operating systems (Windows, Unix and/or Linux), Virtualization & SAN technologies, Application support (AD, SQL, Citrix) and Cloud infrastructure. 

 

 This role interacts and works with Optus Business’ managed customers to complete operational and project work, ensuring that the client’s needs are being met and assisting our clients in getting the most effective use of their Information Technology environment. 

 

 If you're looking to start a fantastic career path, then this opportunity should interest you. We're a great place to work and the team is really focussed on achieving the best outcomes for both the customer and our business. 

 

 It's a fantastic opportunity within one of Australia's most loved ICT and telecommunication brands. 

 

 What does success look like? 

 You’ll probably have: 


	Excellent customer service and communication skills 
	Operational support on server, workstation or storage technologies knowledge 
	Demonstrated experience/knowledge of ITIL practices and complex case management systems (e.g. HP SM 7 or ITSM) 
	Experience in supporting technologies, such as; Server or workstation hardware (HP, Dell, Sun, etc.),

	Demonstrated knowledge with storage arrays (e.g. NetApp, TAC2 [Symmetrix VMAX, Clariion] or HDS) 
 

 
This role would suit a recent graduate within this space. 

 You're a driven individual with a strong focus within the industry. You will embody both Optus and our client’s vision, values and corporate ethos all in one package! 

 

 We aren’t just a Telco anymore; we are a company of innovation, we have moved to the forefront of technology and entertainment. We are a part of the digital disruption, changing the way we deliver media services and content to you; continuing to create experiences that move you.

 If this sounds like you, then we’ll be excited about seeing your application. 

 

 Before you call/apply please be aware that this role involves work for the Australian Government and will potentially have access to classified information/resources. As such, a security clearance is required and therefore it is a requirement that the successful candidate be an Australian Citizen. 

 Heads Up!! 
Due to the fast paced nature of the Optus business, our vacancy close dates may be subject to change. Don’t delay, make sure you apply as soon as possible. We will assess applications as they are received.
One last thing, Optus operates a direct sourcing model so no agency introductions, sorry folks.

The Role

forging partnerships with key media outlets, influencers and brands;
building relationships with content collaborators, both internal and external; exploring more experiential marketing initiatives – podcasting, workshops and more guerilla tactics. We’re looking for a creative thinker who is not afraid to step out of the box and propose innovative ideas to break into emerging digital platforms; and learning and growing with a team that has developed an award-winning business and marketing strategy. We’ve been recognised for marketing, innovation, diversity, client service and more!

excellent copywriter
design skills in Photoshop, InDesign and Illustrator
experience in WordPress, HTML or CSS
data-driven and analytical mindset
Working at LegalVision
Grow with us – a growing business is a constant source of new opportunities
Do cool stuff – if you have a cool idea, then what are you waiting for?
Choose your destiny – if you have a valuable skill, tell us about it. We’ll use whatever resources we have to serve our clients and grow our business
Work the way you want – wear what you want, work flexibly, be agile, #startuplyf
Get silly together – we eat and drink as a team, celebrate our wins and clap each other out of the building

Attach your CV, cover letter and academic transcript. This part-time position (3-4 days per week) is based in our Surry Hills, NSW office.
