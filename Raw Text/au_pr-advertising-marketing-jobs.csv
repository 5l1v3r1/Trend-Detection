Position:
Account Management


Work Type:
Full Time Work





Liquid Ideas has long been Australia's leading lifestyle and hospitality communications agency and we are on the look-out for someone to join the team who is a specialist in the world of booze, hospitality and good times.


The brief is simple. Have a great attitude. Understand what is hot and what is not in the world of wine, spirits, beer and hospitality both here in Australia and abroad. Be able to communicate succinctly, cleverly, creatively and quickly.
Have a handle on every social media handle around.
Understand the power of communication to the worlds of new and old media.
Our client mix includes some great restaurants including the all new Sydney-based Chin Chin and the incredible new Kisume in Melbourne, many of the spirits from the brilliant Beam Suntory stable, wineries across the country and a few exciting hospitality projects we cannot yet reveal. And the boss co-owns Four Pillars – so the bar is, literally, always open.
If you have communications, PR or marketing experience that will be to your distinct advantage. But if you don’t and you have everything else, then please don’t be afraid to throw your hat in the ring.
Our offices are in Alexandria and we currently have a full-time staff of 22 including traditional PR practitioners, social media gurus, an in-house content and creative team and great business support. Liquid Ideas is a massive believer in constant improvement and has one of the best cultures and training regimes in the industry.
The Account Manager position will involve: 

Implementing and administering client marketing and PR campaigns
Development of integrated, clever and creative client campaign strategies
Contributing to the creative idea generation for all clients
Developing long term, effective relationships with clients, media and influencers in the food, drink and hospitality space
Working with the design team to create content for clients
Strong understanding of media connections across all sectors
Creative implementation of client events

A dynamic, driven and hungry personality
Attention to detail and a genuine desire to work to high standards
A willingness to learn and be mentored
A high level of motivation, energy and drive to achieve
Outstanding verbal and written communication skills
Excellent organisation and time management skills
Outstanding social media skills

Liquid Ideas is not your average public relations agency – and we are not looking for any average talent. If you have drive, passion, smarts and love life as well as a good laugh then apply now at .
