The company now seeks to employ a Project Financial Controller to provide finance leadership and management to development projects.
You will report to the company Finance Director (FD), and will play a critical role in leading projects and driving commercial success, supporting the Project Development Manager (PDM). In addition to providing full traditional accounting, reporting, treasury, taxation and controls support to the project, you will develop a complete commercial and contractual understanding of the project, and compile and maintain the Project Business Plan.

At the same time it is highly hands-on and detail-focused.

Have demonstrable understanding of planning and working on projects
Have had exposure to commercial negotiation and bottom-line focus
Be an effective communicator to varied and senior audiences

Senior Quant phD candidates - ""Google"" type Hedge Fund, exceptionally smart people - Central London
£100k plus 20% sign on/guaranteed bonus plus company bonus, multiple of salary
 
Our client is one of the most creative and successful hedge fund businesses, likened to being the ""Google"" of hedge funds. They are hiring Quants who will generate alpha through creating algorithms to identify and exploit inefficiencies in capital markets. They give Quants the intellectual freedom to research independently & pursue areas that interest them. They have incredible Quant retention and they have paid bonuses every year (14 years), have shown excellent performance year on year & are a stable company with the ability to monetise strategies. They offer a relaxed environment (most of the Quants rock up at 9.30/10 and leave 6.30/7), they have the brightest talent there & offer an almost academic feel with financial rewards.
They have an environment where you will be spending at least 80% of your time on your own research and we have a great deal of greenfield work to do. A good example of this is one of the quants they hired last summer who has come in, had an idea, and was given 100% of his time to work on it - it was rolled out in to the production portfolio and has been successful. You will be given a great deal of autonomy and can research your own ideas.
Although equities are still their core business, we work FX and have also recently rolled out futures.  You will have the potential to become an expert in this field. 
As a low profile business, the package is one of the clearest signals they can give of their quality and is the most communicable. They would like the level to be sufficiently high to spark interest amongst the best quants in academia and become part of their reputation. The quality of their people, combined with the £100,000 base starting salary are some of the signs of their confidence to continue on their quality direction. The additional bonuses are fully conditional on company performance, but for Quants who come in and do well should be expecting to make multiples of their base salary once assuming they have come up with valuable contributions. 
THE PROFILE
They look at PhD level candidates and PostDocs with a background in Mathematics/Physics/Statistics/Finance/other numerical subjects. They are very keen to see postdoc candidates as well as those still completing their PhDs as well as those who have some experience so we really are open.
They don't need finance experience or even a particular interest in finance (they have decided that they we're happy to train on this aspect of the role) but they would expect some reading around finance before interviewing.
They are also interested in exceptional candidates toward the end of the second year of the PhDs ready for when they complete their studies.
You need to have some coding ability or at the very least they can show they have the ability think algorithmically and they can demonstrate they could translate their ideas/alphas in to something that could be coded up as an algorithm
 
If you have a strong quant background and would like a confidential discussion please email

They analyse every project and hand-pick a team of experienced freelance consultants to tackle it. For clients, this means tailored expertise at highly competitive rates. For consultants, it’s the freedom to focus purely on client issues.

They have delivered 1800+ projects in strategy, operations, transformation and organisation, working in all major sectors and regions of the world
Their 300+ clients include a third of the FTSE100, a third of the world’s largest private equity firms, and 50 of the global Fortune 500, as well as a large number of mid-sized corporates
Their 1500+ independent consultants are truly outstanding. They have backgrounds with top strategy firms as well as the pragmatism borne of experience in industry. They are committed, energetic, and adaptable
Their offices are located in London, Amsterdam and Zurich
They are recognised as a pioneer and disruptive innovator in professional services, frequently referenced by leading business journalists as well as the subject of several Harvard Business School and London Business School case studies

Retail and Consumer is one of their largest practices and they have served over 100 companies ranging from grocers, department stores, specialty retailers, leisure retailers, and pure play digital retailers to niche consumer goods companies and global FMCG companies. As an Associate Client Partner, you work very closely with Client Partners to help them further develop their client relationships and ensure that they deliver well-structured projects that exceed their clients’ expectations. As an Associate Client Partner you will:

Join with Client Partners in developing relationships with new and existing clients, introducing them to the firm and engaging them in insightful conversations about issues of relevance to them
Scope and structure projects for clients and write compelling proposals. This involves drawing on all of your and the firm’s experience to tailor an approach to the specifics of each client situation and working closely with our internal team to select consultants for each project role and craft strong teams
Remain close to each project and ensure that it is on track, that consultants remain positive and productive, and that clients are delighted with progress. You will not be involved in the day-to-day problem solving, but you need to stay close enough to both clients and consultants to respond to shifts in scope and new issues arising
Be working on multiple projects and opportunities in parallel, with at least one other Client Partner
Be an ambassador for their firm with potential consultants and play a key role in assessing new joiners - as well as build trusting and collaborative relationships with the consultants on their projects

 
Likely Experience and Skills
You will have had a successful career in a top tier international strategy consulting firm up to senior manager or principal level.  You will have spent substantial time serving clients in retail and consumer goods, preferably in the UK. In addition, you may have held a line role in strategy for a large corporate or an executive role in a smaller company, again preferably in retail or consumer goods. As a result you have developed the following skills:
 

You have an understanding of how major client relationships are built, and have a track record of helping create and grow significant long term strategy consulting relationships, hence you are not daunted by expectations of generating your own revenue platform prior to election
You can influence decision-making and have a broad knowledge of consulting approaches to help clients resolve their issues as well as an understanding of the issues facing retail and consumer goods clients
You simplify complex problems, understand the underlying issues, and structure pragmatic consulting projects
You communicate logically and fluently, both in proposal writing and in synthesising findings
You are at ease juggling and prioritising a number of different project situations – all the while demonstrating grace under pressure and maintaining a sense of humour and perspective

 
Additional Qualities
Their culture and the way in which they engage with both clients and consultants is a major factor in our success. To be successful as an Associate Client Partner they believe that you will also need to be:

A skilled and highly motivated relationship builder who gets energy from engaging with people and their business issues, and cares about their success
Highly empathetic and able to engage and motivate our highly talented independent consultants, while respecting the unique nature of our relationship with them
Highly collaborative in your approach to working with colleagues, consultants, and clients
Obsessive about high standards and excellence in all aspects of what you do
A valid work permit is required for the United Kingdom.

Launchpad

Marketing communications is in the middle of a revolution.  The old ways of working are changing faster now than the industry has ever seen before.
Our mantra has always been to “Dig Deeper, Imagine More”. Today, this means we’re excited by marrying the magic of creativity with the potential offered by technology, to enable ideas we’ve never had before.  For our 2017 entry level programme, we’re looking for the revolutionaries to help us drive this change at Cohn & Wolfe London.
Whether you’re an engineer, designer, data geek, aspiring news editor or biochemist you could play a central role in our agency’s future and we want to hear from you.
We’re a curious bunch and together, we’re not only changing our global structure but we’re also reimagining what communications can look like for our clients whether it’s building  or   It’s led us to win 17 Cannes Lions in the last year.
This is not an internship or temp programme – you can leave your printing and tea-making skills at the door.  We’ll give you the opportunity to walk right into a dynamic and global team, delivering award winning creative campaigns for clients that deliver at scale.  As part of our fast track Launchpad programme, you’ll get the right mix of training and entry-level experience you need to kick-start your career.  We’ll also give you the chance to work across multiple markets.

What we ask of you
We want the very best candidates who are passionate, curious and like us relentlessly restless. We also need candidates who can think critically to answer our clients’ challenges. Therefore we have a three stage application process that’s not for the faint hearted.
Step 1 – Launchpad application form completed by 21st June 2017
Step 2 – From the applications we receive, we’ll select a short list of candidates who’ll be invited to participate in an assessment day on the 30th June 2017 in London, UK
Step 3 – A final list of candidates will be invited in for face to face interviews at Cohn & Wolfe’s offices during July
Successful candidates will start the Launchpad programme at Cohn & Wolfe on 4th September 2017
 What’s in it for you?
Cohn & Wolfe London is an exciting and dynamic place to work but it can be hard to get started and we know living in London isn’t cheap. Therefore, we’re committed to providing you with a package that ensures you get settled.
We know you probably won’t be rooming in Fitzrovia from the start, so to help you get from A to B, in addition to our competitive starting salary, and money upfront to help with your rent deposit, we’ll offer you an interest free travel loan.
As a global agency, we also want to provide you with the opportunity to work together with our international partners. Therefore, whether you fancy croissants in Paris or Moleskines in Milan, we’ll give you the option to include a 2 week placement in another C&W European office on your promotion to Account Executive.
You’ll have the opportunity to learn on the job with bespoke training throughout the year. We’ll also host an intensive Freshers Week Training Schedule in the first week of September so you’re equipped with everything you need for the year ahead.

REQUIREMENTS
So are you up for it?
We’re excited about how the industry is changing and are passionate about our role in leading this change.
If you’re the type of person that’s never happy standing still and are always asking why, then we can’t wait to hear from you. Yes, Hollyoaks is about to start and the washing up might still be on the sideboard, but this could be the start of something special so head to the application page and get stuck in.
BENEFITS
We have a great range of benefits which you can tailor to suit you and your lifestyle. Because we know how tough it is to make it in London we will also provide successful candidates with a £2000 signing on bonus to help you get settled in the Big Smoke. Finally, we will also provide you with the option of an instant interest free season ticket loan to ease the cost of commuting in London.

388925505,Management Consultant,2016-05-17T19:26:54Z,1,"When we ask someone to join The Berkeley Partnership, it’s a big decision, for us and for them. 
We work with big, high profile clients, shaping and delivering complex and transformational change. Our partners and consultants help these organisations tackle their most critical challenges, often by working as an integral part of their leadership teams. Our focus is always on making change happen, making it successful and making it last.  Our people focus on building trusting, long term client relationships and only selling work that clients need and want. We truly believe this is key to our long-term success over the past 26 years, and our repeat/referral business supports this.
That’s why we can’t afford to compromise on the quality of people we hire. At Berkeley we develop talented consultants rather than hire in at the most senior levels, so it is important to us that we hire people at the right point in their career. We look for high achievers with 6 – 10 years consulting experience working in high quality, often large consulting firms.  Joiners will have a proven project leadership track record, and the ability to build strong relationships with blue-chip clients.
But meeting our requirements is only part of the story. Life at The Berkeley Partnership is very different from larger firms. With freedom, trust and autonomy comes a high level of accountability. This is by no means a soft option. There’s a strong focus on personal and professional development, with a partner to consultant ratio of 1:3. We don’t do hierarchy. There are just two levels, Partner and Consultant and if the offer of Partnership comes, you’ll know it means something.
Being owner-managed, we can shape the kind of firm we want to work in. We offer our consultants the chance to develop themselves professionally across a range of sectors and types of consulting work. Our trusting, warm and open culture makes Berkeley both a professional and sociable place to work, with high levels of autonomy and little bureaucracy. You’ll need to be adaptable and open minded about different ways of working and projects/industry sectors that are outside of your comfort zone. Sometimes you’ll be leading, sometimes supporting, but the focus will always be on doing the best possible consulting work for our clients. Sometimes you’ll be on your own, although there’s always support from your colleagues when you need it. The pressure can be every bit as high as you’ve experienced before but most of our people find it easier to balance their work and personal interests in a smaller, more flexible firm.
You’ll find our recruitment process thorough and demanding but friendly too. We know it’s a big time commitment, so we urge you to read our website carefully before taking the next step. If you are the right person for us and are ready for a significant career move, it’s time well spent.
If you’d like to find out more about  at Berkeley, please visit our website.
