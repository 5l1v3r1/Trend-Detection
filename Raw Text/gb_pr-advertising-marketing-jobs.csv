You’ll then work closely with the IT and UX teams, immersing yourself in the Agile process to track projects, rank tickets by order of importance, and ultimately ensure they are delivered on time. Additional areas of focus will include monitoring the tone of voice across sites, ensuring consistency on other platforms (mobile, tablet) and communicating changes internally throughout the business. What experience you’ll needIdeally experience working for an eCommerce business, either pureplay or multi-channel. Experience with Google Analytics, MVT and A/B testing, or similar tools. Candidates with a digital background will still be considered, as long as they possess a passion for eCommerce. Knowledge of user research and an analytical mindset. Excellent communication skills to work with stakeholders at a variety of levels. What you’ll get in return for your talentsSalary here is up to £24k depending on experience, further to additional benefits on request.

Senior Digital Content Manager - Germany€Competitive + Bonus + Package + RelocationI am keen to speak to Senior Content strategists with strong ecommerce credentials about a brand-new position with one of my key clients based in Germany.My client is a global brand, looking to build up their own digital capabilities as they embrace a D2C business model, moving away from their wholesale background. As a result of this transition, they are building their Digital experience team to ensure that customers can connect with the brand at each digital touchpoint through inspirational content.This is a role that has huge scope - you will define the end to end content strategy, governance and guidelines for the entire brand in Western Europe, and work with teams on a global level to share best practise and ideas to ultimately drive consumer sales.Day to day, the Senior Digital Content Manager will be responsible for:Creating a content strategy that drives digital story telling - you will work with teams to ensure that the right content is delivered in the right place at the right time - be that to compliment new product launches, sport events, fashion week etc.Defining Content Governance and guidelines - educate the business of content best practise.Act as the link between digital content and digital customer experience - advise the rest of the business of the best way to use content to drive engagement with customers.Lead the production of digital assets (copy and image) and work with various teams to create product assets and define what assets need to be created to display and drive products.This role would suit someone who has strong Content Management experience in an ecommerce environment, as well as vast experience defining content guidelines - you are passionate about content marketing, and digital storytelling through smart content, and you have the gravitas to create and implement content best practise guidelines at international level. You will be analytical and detail orientated and would not be fazed delivering large scale Content projects across multiple territories. You will be quick thinking and adept at solving problems. Most importantly, your stakeholder management skills will be second to none; this role will work with stakeholders across multiple territories and time zones, some who 'get digital' some who don't - as such, you will have to be confident to influence and build relationships with these teams to ensure results.It is important to note that this is not an editorial role and would not be right for candidates who are looking to remain hands on with content creation as there is a separate team who delivers copy for the brand. However, you will work incredibly close with Brand teams and business units to plan what content and digital assets are needed for Ecommerce channels, and then see these plans through to implementation.To find out more, please send your CV to Cat Symons - either directly, or via LinkedIN

That's why I'm passionate about marketing. From the latest TV spot, through Twitter, right down to how customer loyalty schemes work; every channel fascinates me.But the evolution of marketing is reaching a giddy-speed. So I'm proud to say I remain a committed student of marketing. Reading the relevant press, books and blogs is critical to keeping me relevant and informed. This knowledge allows me to constantly question how our industry works and where it's going.I immerse myself in Client's business so I have a detailed, first-hand knowledge of what they do. I want know everything about their sector, how competitors are behaving and constantly track the latest goings on. To inform my proposals and projects, I experience their brands and products at every opportunity.To drive innovation, I share my thoughts and ideas with Clients all the time. Not only does this demonstrate my commitment and value to their business but also builds on the agencies reputation as having the brightest brains in the business. And I never forget that I'm a person too (consumer is such a soulless word). So I constantly use my own experiences to put effective marketing into a personal context. It explains why I question everything. This helps me understand what works. My curiosity is insatiable. And this relentless quest for knowledge means I can add value to everything I do. Never a shrinking wallflower, sharing objective and informed opinions comes naturally to me - whether I'm in a meeting or having a corridor chat.Quite simply, I like people. I know it's important to have a social relationship with both my Clients and colleagues. I'm happy to enjoy a drink (and good old gossip). I like to share my passions and I always take an interest in those enjoyed by others. I'm a high-energy person. So I bring this enthusiasm to my day-to-day work by getting involved in stuff that will help enrich Agency life. I'm the sort of person who jumps at chances (but still keeps my feet on the ground). I rarely say no and I'm good at managing multiple responsibilities. I love being part of a group that reflects what's important to me - ambitious, energetic and passionate. Thriving off those around me, I always want to make things better for the team. I prefer shared goals; success is about winning together. If so, then call me! Hannah - 0207 845 7243

565585469,Sales & Marketing Capability Controller (FMCG),2017-06-07T01:09:17Z,1,"A fantastic opportunity to join a major, fast-paced FMCG business with a fun, driven culture, top brands and exciting campaigns, in a senior commercial capability position developing and implementing the sales and marketing capability strategy.Reporting into the Head of Business Operations, this position is the sole senior capability role so needs someone self starting who can drive the agenda and take ownership, ideally also someone with the potential to progress into the commercial leadership team, which would be the next step. Ideally you'll have commercial capability experience from a blue chip organisation, but you might be an FMCG Marketing Manager (ideally with some sales experience) or in a Senior National Account Manager/National Account Controller position at an FMCG business with an interest in a move to capability, or you might come from a relevant capability agency background.You'll need to be able to build teams, have vision, lead change, develop people, have a level of self-awareness and empathy, and importantly have commercial acumen. Experience in training and development would be ideal, but not essential.A genuinely great, progressive and growing business to work for - driven and highly accountable, but equally fun loving and go to efforts to create a great environment to be in. This is rare opportunity to join at a senior level and impact and influence the business in an important, high visibility position.For the right candidate this could also possibly be a part time role (minimum four days per week).*Due to the high volume of applications we receive we cannot always respond to everyone. You will hear from us in 2-3 days if your application has been successful.
