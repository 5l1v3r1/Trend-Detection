 COMPANY OVERVIEW


In 1979, Canon Singapore Pte Ltd was set up as the regional headquarters to oversee operations in the Asia-Pacific region. It sets and spearheads sales and marketing strategies for the region, manages and coordinates the region's organisation, sales, service, training, information network and distribution.

	KYOSEI PHILOSOPHY

	Living and Working Together for the Common Good

	Behind every success story lies a strong guiding principle. At Canon, this principle is embodied in the word kyosei -which means living and working together for the common good.

	This philosophy is built into every aspect of our business. From the product development stage, we only conduct research that is original and which has no threat to the environment.

 

History


 Canon started out in 1937 with the vision to make the best camera for the world. More than seven decades later, it is a global leader not only in photography but also with a wide portfolio of products for consumers and businesses. Canon Singapore Pte Ltd was established in 1979 and oversees the South & Southeast Asia region.

Cultures and Values

In alleviating environmental problems, we consider environmental factors at every stage of a product life. We have initiated the world's only cartridge recycling programme and a copier re-manufacturing plant in Scotland to reuse all materials. Our manufacturing plant has also eliminated the use of CFCs and tricholoroethane since 1993.

	To solve today's environmental problems, we are also creating future products and technologies to reduce demands on the planet's resources. One of them is the ssolar cell panels that will soon be our potential source of energy. With bioremediation research, we are also focusing on micro-organisms to break down toxic waste.

	Our environmental efforts extend to the ways Canon products are used. Not only are our business machines quiet, but also emissions are low in toxic and energy consumption.

 COMPANY OVERVIEW

It is the designated Public Postal Licensee (PPL) for Singapore providing domestic and international postal services as well as end-to-end mail solutions such as data printing, letter-shopping, delivery and mailroom management. As a logistics provider, SingPost offers domestic and international door-to-door delivery services, including express delivery (Speedpost) along with warehousing, fulfillment and distribution services.

SingPost owns one of the largest retail distribution networks in Singapore with its extensive tri-channel network of over 60 post offices, 300-odd Self-service Automated Machines (SAM) and the online shopping and shipping portal vPOST. SingPost was listed on the Main Board of the SGX-ST on 13 May 2003. The company has won many awards and accolades. It is the only postal company in the world to have won the Express Mail Service (EMS) Cooperative Certification Gold Level Award by the Universal Postal Union for its Speedpost Worldwide Courier Service for 10 consecutive years since 2001. It was also named runners-up in the “Most Transparent Company Award 2010” for the fifth consecutive year in the SIAS Investors’ Choice Awards.

 WHY JOIN US?

Our Vision
To be a regional leader in e-commerce logistics and trusted communications.
 
Our Values
A SingPost culture that embodies the 5Ts - Trust, Total Customer, One Team, Top Execution and Transformation.
 

At SingPost, we're always thinking about the future. Our people are our most valuable asset - the building blocks of our success as we step up our transformation and growth.
 
Since listed on the Main Board of the SGX-ST on 13 May 2003, we have grown from strength-to-strength, helmed by a dynamic leadership and dedicated staff.  As one of the top 10 finalists of the inaugural Tripartite Alliance for Fair Employment Practices' Exemplary Employer Award 2010 which recognises companies for their progressive and fair employment practices, SingPost continued to drive equal opportunities programmes. With support from UTES, we continued to encourage re-employment of older staff who enjoy unchanged employment terms.
 
SingPost has been re-employing retired staff since 1994, tapping on the wealth of expertise and experience of the matured workers. SingPost is one of the few companies that had been implementing its own re-employment policies before 2007 when the Government announced plans for a re-employment law by 2012. In May 2009, SingPost's Chairman, Mr Lim Ho Kee was conferred the NTUC's Medal of Commendation Award for helping to promote continued employment beyond retirement.
 
We are excited about the possibilities that lie ahead, and we welcome talented individuals who can partner us to achieve our vision of being a world-class provider of total communication and distribution needs. We reward performance, provide excellent training and help you carve an interesting career path.
 
SingPost's staff are driven to deliver their best for their customers, whether behind the scenes or serving them directly. Some even go beyond the call of duty to help the people they serve daily, and their efforts won the hearts of our customers. This can be seen from the number of compliments pouring since we launched 'Thumbs Up!' in September this year. In less than three months, we have received more than 1,300 compliments from appreciative customers.

 COMPANY OVERVIEW

In 1957, an avid and passionate motoring enthusiast Tan Sri Loh Boon Siew formed Boon Siew Sdn. Bhd. In the next year, Tan Sri Loh met Soichiro Honda, the founder of Honda Motor Co., Ltd and quickly a business partnership is formed. Since then Honda is synonymous with Tan Sri Loh Boon Siew and Kah Motor Co. Sdn. Bhd. was set up in 1969 to further Honda automobile business in Malaysia and Singapore. Today Kah Motor Co. Sdn. Bhd. continues to provide Singapore motorists with successive generations of better and more advanced Honda models. Boasting more than 37 years with the Honda brand, we are positioning ourselves to serve Singapore in the years to come.

 
Our close relationship with Honda Motor Co., Ltd reflects the close, personal working relationship that the late Tan Sri Loh Boon Siew had with the late Soichiro Honda. Working in tandem with Honda Research & Development Tochigi Co. Ltd, we continually strive to develop a complete model line up that is optimised for use in Singapore.
 
As Singapore’s exclusive distributor, we boast an extensive sales, service and spare parts Honda network. The entire range of Honda-approved models can be viewed and test-driven in two strategically located Honda Centres. Both centres are characterised by its complete Sales and Service facilities. Both centres are supported by a spare parts facility where a wide range of genuine Honda parts, lubricants, accessories and care car products are available. The Ubi Honda Centre also houses Kah Motor’s headquarters and a fully stocked parts inventory.
 
In addition, there are also six other service centres located strategically across Singapore to serve the maintenance and repair needs of Kah Motor's customers. Body Repair and Paint workshops are located in Ubi and Mandai to meet the needs of owners requiring more extensive repairs. Kah Motor also offers rental and leasing services with a wide selection of Honda automobiles to choose from.

 
Kah Motor Company is the distributor of Honda automobiles and power products and we are part of Malaysian public listed company Oriental Holdings Bhd. 



 


 WHY JOIN US?


Honda is one of the world’s leading advanced-technology mobility companies. It is the world’s largest manufacturer of clean, fuel-efficient internal combustion engines, and motorcycles.

As the official distributor of Honda automobiles in Singapore, Kah Motor shares the belief with Honda that each person working in, or coming in contact with our company, directly or through our products, should share a sense of joy throughout that experience.
 

The Joy of Buying is for every customer who is glad that they bought a Honda product.
The Joy of Selling is for those who can recommend a product with confidence.
The Joy of Creating is for those who create quality products with unique ideas and technologies.

 
Guided by our beliefs, we invite inspired individuals who believe in the power of dreams to be part of our family at Kah Motor.
