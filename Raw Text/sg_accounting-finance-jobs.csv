Before the church building was completed, worship services were conducted in the open air and later in a temporary shed.  
In 1967, with God’s enabling, the founding pastor of Faith Methodist Church, Rev T.C Nga and his team saw to the completion of the church building, which we share with our sister Chinese Methodist Church. The church was named Faith Methodist Church in honour of God’s faithfulness in the entire project and in memory of Faith Goh, the only daughter of Dr Goh & Mrs Goh Kok Kee, who were gracious donors to the church building fund.  
By God's faithfulness, Faith's membership grew and the church facilities were inadequate to meet the needs of the congregation. Hence, the church building was redeveloped from 2002 to 2003.  
Today, the church building houses a 1000-seat sanctuary, 800-seat worship hall, two levels of parking, as well as a kindergarten, playground, library and a columbarium. The building is also equipped with lifts and ramps to cater to seniors who are mobility-challenged.  
From 38 attendees when it first started, Faith’s congregation has grown to some 2,000+ today.  
Commitment to community outreach and missions is at the heart of Faith. From the setting up of Lakeside Family Centre, Jurong Preaching Point (now Agape Methodist Church) and FaithActs community service agency, to active involvement in international ministry in the regions beyond, by God’s grace, Faith is still transforming lives and changing the world for Christ after four decades.

 COMPANY OVERVIEW

Formerly known as the SAF Non-Commissioned Officers (NCO) Club, The SAF Warrant Officers And Specialists Club's history stretches back to the post-war era.
 
In 1951, the British Armed Services set up the Britannia Club as a recreational place for their servicemen and the allied troops. The club soon became a popular social gathering venue as it provided opportunities for soldiers from diverse backgrounds and nationalities to interact and share experiences.
 
In 1971, the club was handed back to the Singapore government, which was subsequently handed over to the SAF, and in 1974, the SAF NCO Club was formed. The club housed many prominent features, such as the SAF Enterprise (SAFE) Superstore, which offered affordable merchandise and payment schemes for the NCOs. Over the years, the club became increasingly family-oriented and it constantly strived to create opportunities for members to bond and enjoy leisure activities.
 
With the restructuring of the NCO Corps in 1994, the club was renamed the SAF Warrant Officers & Specialists Club. Due to the expansion of the membership base and the allocation of land for redevelopment, the club was relocated to Jurong East and was officially opened on 8 February 2002; with the new identity known as THE CHEVRONS.
 
Our Mission
We create memorable experiences for our members, their families and friends to build esprit de corps and forge closer ties.
 
Our Vision
To be the pride of our members and the SAF; always innovating, always striving to be the best!
 
Core Values
These core values emphasise the club's commitment in carrying out its mission.
Known as P-R-I-D-E, these are the guiding principles that we embrace:

Promote Professionalism by paying attention to members' interests.
Respect the members' feedback and their views.
Instill a spirit of sharing, learning and co-operation among the staff and members.
Deliver quality customer service by discerning members' needs.
Express our commitment by embracing the core values.


 



 


 WHY JOIN US?

Here are just a few reasons why you should join us:

1. CULTURE
At THE CHEVRONS, there is high cohesiveness among us as we work closely, and progress as a team. More uniquely, working in a recreation club is an entirely different experience as we provide you with a resort-style work environment. 
 
2. PEOPLE
Being a multi-nationality club, you will get to work with people from diverse backgrounds and learn from one another. Not only is there an influx of creative new ideas to help the club excel; it makes THE CHEVRONS a fun place to work in.
 
3. SERVICE-ORIENTED
We take pride in serving our members and guests, and believe in going the extra mile to deliver excellent service. 
 
4. CAREER ADVANCEMENT
A fun, enriching and fulfilling career starts with us. We offer you opportunities to learn and grow through training courses, on-the-job training and support from your peers, supervisors and managers. 
 
5. BENEFITS & REWARDS
Our staff will enjoy a full range of comprehensive and attractive benefits.

 COMPANY OVERVIEW

JLO representing Fort is an established group providing B2B/B2C financial portfolio advisory. Partnering a global leading giant in the industry with a reach of over 97 countries worldwide. We focus heavily on providing our services to corporate business(B2B) & provide customized portfolio management for clients(B2C)
 
We are a committed group that is always striving to be better than our yesterday's selves. We are hungry for success & driven by growth, the people that you will be grinding with day in day out, to achieve tip top results.
 

A little background about myself, my name is Joshua Lim, 26. Most people know me as the youngest Senior Executive Vice President of Fort Financial or may have seen me on The Straits Times published on April 2015 & March 2016. Now I'm not saying this to show off or anything. In fact, when I've first started out in poly, my grades were pretty bad. The only thing I knew was to go to the bank or the financial institutes as it pays well, unclear of what I actually like doing. I did my due diligence like everyone out there from researching if the company is reputable to selecting a job that is relevant to my diploma/degree as much as possible to build my resume & gain experience.
 

Like you, I was hungry for success, I didn't want to just be an ordinary candidate that goes for interviews, I want my employers to know that I can be an asset to their company. I handpicked a few of the so called ""reputable companies"" cause initially I thought job hopping would help me rise through the ranks and get a better pay. Yes it works to a ""certain extent""
 
BUT
 

Employers probably have interviewed many equally highly qualified candidates before you, and they know for a fact that millennials won't stay long at their jobs (let's be honest, everyone is just eager to build up quick experiences and job hop to the next for a better pay)... so why would any manager or boss want to invest their time, heart and soul into mentoring you, if you're just going to be yet ""another executive"" to temporarily fill up the position till the next one comes to take over when you leave (let alone even consider giving you a pay raise or bonus)?
 
So you'll probably end up with a starting pay of $2.5K (maybe $3.2k if you're lucky), slog longer hours at the ""reputable company"" just to get 1-2 years experience, and then maybe job hop to another with a ""better resume"" for a slightly higher increment of $300+/- more.
 
That was when I realized I had to find a place that accelerates my personal growth, a place that pushes me to my limits every single day. A place where my hard work & efforts will be acknowledged & recognized.





 


 WHY JOIN US?

In about 3 years+ I have won multiple awards, as seen on The Straits Times on April 2015 or March 2016/2017. No, it wasn't easy, but I have a strong desire to succeed, a craving that I need to quench, which is the main driving force of why I wake up early, the reason why I go to office so willingly. Yet it doesn't feel like I am working, because its fun & most importantly, satisfying.

Currently I am leading a group of like-minded driven individuals towards our bigger end-game. Culture & working environment is important to me, I hate politics & we can't afford dead weights pulling us back. I have groomed & mentored 3 managers & 3 associate managers personally & they are leading their own units right now! We plan to expand & strive toward even BIGGER goals this 2017.

Listen... if that's what you truly want - to accelerate your career growth and get the kind of wealth that your peers can only dream of (and I'm talking about achieving all these within the next 2-3 years)... and if you have the hunger to grow and become one of the top in the finance industry...

Then you definitely don't want to miss out on this opportunity to get explosive growth for your career when you join my team.

""In just 3 months into joining Josh's team, I was earning a stable $6,000+ each month, to comfortably pay for my school fees and to repay my parents. Even my peers who graduated from university the same time as me wasn't earning as much. Plus, I didn't have much experience nor knowledge, but Joshua's coaching has propelled me forward tremendously not just career wise but also my personal growth

Finding passion and enjoying my work is most important to me. I've often heard of how my friends hate their jobs or are waiting for their chance to quit for a better opportunity... but in Josh's team, you'll never find that kind of sentiments in Josh's team, simply because everyone are striving towards the same goal with the same kind of drive and spirit that pushes one another in achieving results that almost defy our own beliefs.""

""I've been a piano teacher over the past 6 years as i have a DipABRSM and graduated from School of the Arts. As most would think, teaching can be an extremely stable, sustainable, lifetime job. Most people wouldn't understand how I feel unless they experience how stagnant it actually is.  As the only child, i was also well aware that i would have to one day be responsible for taking care of my parents through their retirement on my own. With that in mind, i decided to take that leap of faith.

The one thing that drew me to this career, is the fact that i can get rewarded for every bit of sincere hard work put in for every person i meet. It is pretty much similar to opening your own business. Having met Joshua and his team has taught me the fact that nothing is unattainable as long as you put in your 100% effort and soul into it.
 
The determination, the right skill sets, having the opportunity to meet people from all walks of life is not something that just any ordinary career can offer. Never have i once turned back to question my decision joining Joshua. He taught me many invaluable techniques that you won't be able to learn from those so-called experts.""

 COMPANY OVERVIEW

In 1957, an avid and passionate motoring enthusiast Tan Sri Loh Boon Siew formed Boon Siew Sdn. Bhd. In the next year, Tan Sri Loh met Soichiro Honda, the founder of Honda Motor Co., Ltd and quickly a business partnership is formed. Since then Honda is synonymous with Tan Sri Loh Boon Siew and Kah Motor Co. Sdn. Bhd. was set up in 1969 to further Honda automobile business in Malaysia and Singapore. Today Kah Motor Co. Sdn. Bhd. continues to provide Singapore motorists with successive generations of better and more advanced Honda models. Boasting more than 37 years with the Honda brand, we are positioning ourselves to serve Singapore in the years to come.

 
Our close relationship with Honda Motor Co., Ltd reflects the close, personal working relationship that the late Tan Sri Loh Boon Siew had with the late Soichiro Honda. Working in tandem with Honda Research & Development Tochigi Co. Ltd, we continually strive to develop a complete model line up that is optimised for use in Singapore.
 
As Singapore’s exclusive distributor, we boast an extensive sales, service and spare parts Honda network. The entire range of Honda-approved models can be viewed and test-driven in two strategically located Honda Centres. Both centres are characterised by its complete Sales and Service facilities. Both centres are supported by a spare parts facility where a wide range of genuine Honda parts, lubricants, accessories and care car products are available. The Ubi Honda Centre also houses Kah Motor’s headquarters and a fully stocked parts inventory.
 
In addition, there are also six other service centres located strategically across Singapore to serve the maintenance and repair needs of Kah Motor's customers. Body Repair and Paint workshops are located in Ubi and Mandai to meet the needs of owners requiring more extensive repairs. Kah Motor also offers rental and leasing services with a wide selection of Honda automobiles to choose from.

 
Kah Motor Company is the distributor of Honda automobiles and power products and we are part of Malaysian public listed company Oriental Holdings Bhd. 



 


 WHY JOIN US?

As the official distributor of Honda automobiles in Singapore, Kah Motor shares the belief with Honda that each person working in, or coming in contact with our company, directly or through our products, should share a sense of joy throughout that experience.
 

The Joy of Buying is for every customer who is glad that they bought a Honda product.
