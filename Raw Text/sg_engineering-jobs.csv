 COMPANY OVERVIEW



		The venture that started off in a modest rented shop house back in 1988 has now blossomed into one of Singapore’s most robust infrastructure companies. KTC Group has grown from a start-up earth-moving contractor into a multi-discipline grade A1 civil engineering enterprise with business interests in both Singapore and Indonesia. The name KTC is synonymous with reliable and top quality services in the areas of Civil and Infrastructure works, Earthwork and Specialized Basement Excavation, Building Construction, Coal Mining and Coal Trading.

		 

		While earthwork services remain our mainstay in Singapore, our teams have impressed our demanding clients with our civil engineering, infrastructures and building works having successfully contributed some critical structural elements to the iconic Marina Bay Sands Integrated Resorts project.

		 

		Our entry into the coal industry started as a mining sub-contractor in Kalimantan. As a result of the foresight and dynamism of our management we have carved a niche for ourselves as a coal trader in this highly challenging industry.

		 

		Housed in our own fully owned headquarters at Pandan Crescent since 2010, the KTC Group is poised to accelerate it growth story by partaking of numerous upcoming infrastructures developments in Singapore and the growing energy demand in the region.

		 

		Our varied business streams are synergistic in nature and help us to offer a comprehensive support to our elite clientele.

 COMPANY OVERVIEW



		The venture that started off in a modest rented shop house back in 1988 has now blossomed into one of Singapore’s most robust infrastructure companies. KTC Group has grown from a start-up earth-moving contractor into a multi-discipline grade A1 civil engineering enterprise with business interests in both Singapore and Indonesia. The name KTC is synonymous with reliable and top quality services in the areas of Civil and Infrastructure works, Earthwork and Specialized Basement Excavation, Building Construction, Coal Mining and Coal Trading.

		 

		While earthwork services remain our mainstay in Singapore, our teams have impressed our demanding clients with our civil engineering, infrastructures and building works having successfully contributed some critical structural elements to the iconic Marina Bay Sands Integrated Resorts project.

		 

		Our entry into the coal industry started as a mining sub-contractor in Kalimantan. As a result of the foresight and dynamism of our management we have carved a niche for ourselves as a coal trader in this highly challenging industry.

		 

		Housed in our own fully owned headquarters at Pandan Crescent since 2010, the KTC Group is poised to accelerate it growth story by partaking of numerous upcoming infrastructures developments in Singapore and the growing energy demand in the region.

		 

		Our varied business streams are synergistic in nature and help us to offer a comprehensive support to our elite clientele.

 COMPANY OVERVIEW



		The venture that started off in a modest rented shop house back in 1988 has now blossomed into one of Singapore’s most robust infrastructure companies.

 WHY JOIN US?

Values are important for everyone.

Each of us as individuals has personal values, based on our experience, our upbringing and cultural background.
It is important for us to also have a common set of values that we can all rely on – no matter, in which country we are.

Course no. 1: Introduction to Professional Engineering (Full Time Programme)
Course Description
This course is the first in a series of professional practice courses that introduces students to professional skills that are integral to an engineering workplace. The focus of all the courses is on integrating professional skills with technical skills. The courses also incorporate academic survival skills and support, particularly in first year.
The course content is delivered by subject specialists and then students are asked to apply their theoretical learning to engineering-based assessments. 
This first year professional practice course explores a number of large-scale issues that are increasingly becoming the focus of engineering across the globe. Adding to this macro picture is a more micro examination of the day to day life of an engineer. The aim of exploring both the macro and micro perspectives is for students to not only gain a realistic picture of what to expect in their future career, but also an understanding of the myriad ways engineers can be part of the solution for some of the issues the world is currently facing.
The course also focuses on developing underpinning skills such as report writing, oral presentation skills, teamwork and WHS that students will need in all years of their program. Students participate in a project of their choosing from provided options. Through the project, they demonstrate teamwork and other core skills.
Each student is required to present a reflective learning journal as part of their assessment.
Course content
The course will introduce students to the engineering process by following a practical project through from start to finish. This will involve but not be limited to:
Problem definition and scoping
Research
Design thinking
Problem solving
Making valid assumptions in engineering
Engineering on both a large and small scale
Design
Testing and evaluation
Communication (both written and oral)
Working in teams
Resource management
Reflection as a learning tool
The project will be supported by additional material delivered in lectures and tutorials to reinforce the above concepts. The students will also be exposed to other aspects of professional engineering including:
Industry speakers
Employability
Legal requirements
Workplace health and safety
International and indigenous topics
Innovation and entrepreneurship
Course no. 2: Ethics, Technology and Engineering (Full Time Programme)
Course Description
The engineering profession aims to facilitate its practice for the common good based on values of ethical behaviour, competent performance, innovative practice, engineering excellence, equality of opportunity, social justice and sustainable development. This course integrates values at a senior level so that on successful completion the student will be able to demonstrate a professional competency embracing all these values with a specific focus on ethical behaviour and a sustainability ethic. Students will be able to demonstrate their ability both orally and in writing; individually and in group situations.
The course teaches engineering ethics appropriate to contemporary Western commercial, political and social contexts of engineering practice. It provides the framework within which social understanding and responsible behaviours are conveyed to future professional engineers. It also examines the ethical implications of contemporary technology in its full technical and organizational complexity.
The course meets Engineering Australia Stage 1 Competency Standard for Professional Engineer (Section 3.1) - Ethical conduct and professional accountability where the professional engineer is to demonstrate commitment to ethics, understand the need for accountability, `due-diligence' and an awareness of intellectual rights.
Course content
The course covers
The basic concepts and moral frameworks of engineering ethics
The techniques of normative analysis of technology and engineering practice
Effective writing and oral communication skills
The complexity of technology and its implications on market and corporate organisation,
The ethical implications of the complexity of technology and of the organisations which design, construct, and operate the technology.

After the completion of share transfer, TMD became a subsidiary wholly-owned by Toshiba Group. Toshiba Matsushita Display Technology Co., Ltd. was thus known as Toshiba Mobile Display Co., Ltd.
 
On 1st July 2010, AU Optronics Corporation acquired 100% shares of AFPD from Toshiba Mobile Display Co., Ltd. It is now a subsidiary, wholly-owned by AU Optronics Corporation (AUO).

 COMPANY OVERVIEW



Samwoh Corporation was incorporated in Singapore in 1975. The company has grown from its humble beginnings into a market leader in construction, maintenance of road, aircraft and seaport pavement, providing civil engineering, infrastructure construction services, supply of building materials, offering specialized blasting systems, recycling of construction and industrial waste, logistic, shipping, consultancy services and research and development. The concept of a “one-stop service” with innovation and sustainability have differentiated Samwoh from others.


 
History


Samwoh was founded as a transport and logistics company in 1975 by three like-minded friends who gave up their jobs to become lorry drivers.
 
The company’s business grew significantly in the 1980s as it secured several key projects including a HDB project to transport granite materials and sand. During this time, the company also ventured into asphalt premix production as well as road paving and milling services.
 
At the start of the 1990s, Samwoh attained L5 registration grade with BCA which qualified the company to tender for projects up to $10 million. This was a period of growth for the company in the road paving business, and it upgraded its asphalt plant to meet growing demand.
 
The new millennium saw a next-generation board of directors (consisting of the founders’ children) take Samwoh into various industries including civil engineering; demolitions; geotechnical services; quarrying activities; precast concrete products; ready-mixed concrete; research and consultancy; recycling; and sea sand supply.
 
Samwoh’s focus on sustainable development garnered the company several prestigious awards including the top prize in the Enterprise 50 Awards twice in a row; the BCA Green Mark Platinum Award for the Samwoh Eco-Green Building; Singapore Compact CSR Award; and various other environmental awards.
 
Despite the company’s success, the management is not resting on its laurels and is continuously seeking new ways to grow and strengthen Samwoh.


 



 


 WHY JOIN US?


The Group is always looking for talented, innovative and result-oriented individuals with commitment to high quality to join our dynamic team. We offer an attractive remuneration package commensurate with experience and there are vast opportunities for career advancement.
 

A key part of our company’s philosophy is treating all our employees as Human Capital; we continuously assess our staff and look for ways to upgrade their skill set, thus improving employability as well as productivity.
 
And it is not all work and no play with us, as we believe in the value of having proper work-life balance. We have sports and recreational activities all year round for all interested staff to take part in. Our company also boasts a gym as well as karaoke facilities.

 COMPANY OVERVIEW



Separation Technologies Applied Research and Translation (START) Centre

		 

		Historically, one of the biggest challenges for commercialization of novel technologies, even if IP protected, is the gap between laboratory processes, results and testing, and the full scale final product.

		 

		The Separation Technologies Applied Research and Translation (START) is being set up under the Innovation Cluster Programme (ICP) to bridge this gap. START will provide significant risk mitigation, and subsequently, a platform for the potential commercialization of materials, equipment and processes related to separations technology.

		 

		The benefits would be multiple, providing Singapore’s Institutions of Higher Learning, and research institutions, a much needed platform to take their innovative research and technologies forward to actual products, in partnership with key companies, both global and local.  It will also help train researchers, especially those in the early stage of their careers, in the challenges and opportunities associated with scale-up towards potential commercialization.


	 



 


 WHY JOIN US?


	We offer an energetic work environment for self starters who relish the challenges of being in a technology commercialisation and start up company.

 COMPANY OVERVIEW


	Our Company was incorporated in Singapore on 1 August 2014 under the name of Huationg Global Private Limited.

	 

	We commenced operations on 6 September 1983 and were engaged in works for various civil infrastructure projects, in particular the construction of army camps in Singapore. We expanded our operations overseas in the 1990s. In 1990, we took part in our first overseas project when we were engaged by P.T. Pilar Reliancetama Kontraktor, to provide civil engineering and earthworks services for the construction of the Batamindo Industrial Park in Batam, Indonesia.

	 

	We participated in three other overseas projects in 1994. We provided earthworks services and inland logistics support services for the construction of the Wuxi-Singapore Industrial Park in Wuxi, China and the China-Singapore Suzhou Industrial Park in Suzhou, China. We also performed earthworks services for the construction of the 265-room Summit Parkview Hotel in Yangon, Myanmar.

	 

	In 1995, we provided earthworks services for the construction of Lobam Industrial Estate in Bintan Island, Indonesia. In the same year, we were also engaged by Bintan Industrial Estate Management Pte Ltd to provide civil engineering services for the construction of an 18-hole golf course, a clubhouse and villas at Bintan Lagoon Golf and Beach Resort in Bintan Island, Indonesia. Further, we also provided earthworks and roadworks services in the construction of the road to Simpang Lagoi.

	 

	Over the years, we have completed various major engineering projects such as Downtown Line MRT project, Circle Line MRT stations, Marina Coastal Expressway, Kallang-Paya Lebar Expressway and Watertown Mixed Development Project.

	 

	We also developed and successfully commercialized our LSS product as an alternative for the backfilling of basements and other MRT construction projects in Singapore. We have completed some major LSS projects such as Singapore Marina Bayfront Bridges, Singapore Sports Hub and Marina Bay Sands.

	 

	 


		Our Group’s businesses can be categorized into three main segments:


 Civil Engineering Services


		 

		We provide a full range of civil engineering services from earthworks, infrastructure works, external works, demolition and excavation works, site clearance, drainage works, reinforcing bar installation, formwork, concrete installation, backfill and compaction to final handover. We have completed civil engineering works for numerous large infrastructural construction projects in Singapore and our customers in this segment include, among others, Housing and Development Board (HDB), Land Transport Authority (LTA), and Daelim Industrial Co. Ltd..

		 

		In addition, we also operate and manage entire stockpile sites for our customers, performing collection to handling to provision of site management staff, administrative staff, operation staff, clerical staff and all other essential manpower required to ensure continuous and daily operation of the stockpile sites.

		 


Inland Logistics Support


		 

		We provide inland logistics support through the provision of a wide range of construction equipment, including, among others, tipper trucks, compactors, excavators, concrete pumps. We are able to provide experienced drivers and operators who are familiar with the equipment. 

		 

		Concrete pumps, comprising two different types of pumps, namely the “truck-mounted boom pump” and the “stationary pump”, may be used to transfer pre-mixed concrete to designated locations such high-rise buildings, where accuracy is required and which the alternative method of pouring may not be able to achieve. The truck-mounted boom pump is often used in large-scale construction projects and utilises a foldable and retractable remote controlled arm to transfer large volumes of concrete to specified areas. It is usually used in the construction of basements or buildings of up to 62 metres in height. On the other hand, stationary pumps are used largely for the construction of high-rise buildings of more than 62 metres in height.

		 


Sale of Construction Materials


		 

		In 2004, we began recycling construction waste and aggregates at the Sarimbun Recycling Park and in 2013, we relocated our recycling operations to Tuas South Avenue 1. The RCA produced are primarily used for our own civil engineering activities, although we do, depending on prevailing market conditions and demand, sell our products to third parties. We currently own two crushers, the Nordberg Primary Lokotrack Mobile Crushing Plant Model LT106 and Nordberg Secondary Lokotrack Mobile Crushing Plant Model LT1100 manufactured by Metso. They are capable of producing fine aggregates, which are used for road construction or trench backfilling, 20 mm aggregates, which are used for ready-mixed concrete, and graded stones, which are used in the construction of road bases. We also own wheel loaders, excavator breakers and weighbridge systems to support our recycling operations.

		 

		We also manufacture and supply LSS, which is a self-flowable, self-compacting, selflevelling material consisting principally of soil and cementitious materials that can be used as a backfill material, replacing conventional compacted fill. LSS consists of soil, water and cementitious material which have been mixed uniformly. The LSS manufacturing process utilises soil which has been excavated in construction projects and which would otherwise be discarded as waste. LSS, which allows easy fill for confined spaces or excavation areas, is considered an alternative to granular fill, which is required to be filled manually, as the former can be placed easily without vibration or tamping. Among other applications, it can be used as nonstructural fill for buildings and other structures, as well as for backfill in utility and road construction. Most of the LSS is used to support our civil engineering activities. As and when there is market demand, we will also supply them to third parties. As we are capable of monitoring and adjusting the nature of the LSS mixtures, including the liquidity and strength of the mixtures, we are able to provide customised solutions to meet the different needs of our customers. LSS is normally delivered in a ready-mixed form by a mixer truck and equipment such as chutes, buckets and concrete pumps may be used to place the material.

		 

		Our customers in this segment include Samsung C&T Corporation, Dragages Singapore Pte Ltd, Ssangyong Engineering & Construction Co Ltd, Daelim Industrial Co., Ltd., Penta-Ocean Construction Company Limited, Bachy Soletanche Singapore Pte. Ltd., Singapore Piling & Civil Engineering Private Limited, Sembawang Engineers and Constructors Pte. Ltd., Nishimatsu Construction Co., Ltd. and Hock Lian Seng Infrastructure Pte. Ltd..


	 



 


 WHY JOIN US?


	Our company is one of the leading civil engineering firms in Singapore with a strong track record. Some of our completed public infrastructural milestones include the latest Loyang Bus Depot and Downtown Line Depot (Advanced Earthworks), among the extensive projects which we have undertaken over the company's history.


		 

		In addition, we are also listed on the Catalist board of the Singapore Exchange (SGX) since December 2014 as a testament to the milestones which our company has achieved over the years of prudent growth and management. 

		 

		Given that Singapore is going through a phase of rejuvenation, our company is actively involved in the masterplan of the country. Our company is actively looking for individuals who are team players and possess the desire to make a positive impact at work and on our future generations.

		 

		Some of the our perks include:

		1. Attractive salary that commensurate with work experience

		2. Career advancement within the company including cross functional training

		3. A safe and yet fun and involving working environment for all our staff
