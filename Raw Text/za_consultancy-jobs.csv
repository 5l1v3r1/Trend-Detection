GTT is a fresh &amp; energetic company, with a team of professional and skilled Recruiters - who have experience in both internal and external recruitment. Our company was established approximately two years ago with the intention to be an extension of the Awethu Project’s Talent Department, and responsible for all their internal recruitment. Thereafter, we also became responsible for the recruitment within Awethu’s new ventures, as the Awethu Project has established various ventures with entrepreneurs who share the Awethu values. Due to this expansion, GTT has continued to blossom, and we have increased our skills and database across various industries.

About the employer
Indwe Risk ServicesIndwe Risk Services (Pty) Ltd is a leading personal, business and specialist risk and insurance advisory business. Indwe came into existence in 2006 – the product of a merger between Thebe Risk Services and Prestasi Brokers, both of which had a formidable history in insurance.
Thebe Risk Services was established in 1903 as Hoskens Insurance and in 1992 became the insurance arm of Thebe Investment Corporation. Prestasi Brokers was established in 1972 and soon gained a reputation for its innovative short-term insurance offerings, becoming a fully empowered organisation in 2001.
When these two insurance leaders joined forces, they took the name Indwe, which is the isiXhosa and isiZulu name for South Africa's national bird, the Blue Crane. Since establishing our new identity, we’ve continued to build on the strengths of our heritage.
In 2016, Indwe announced a new shareholding deal where African Rainbow Capital acquired a majority shareholding of Indwe, with 25% shareholding belonging to Sanlam and Santam retaining 24%. This joint venture has enhanced Indwe’s profile and has provided opportunities for expansion.
While our shareholding has changed, what has not is our commitment to our clients. We provide all our clients with excellent service, innovative products and timeless values that are borne from decades of experience.

Best things:
                    I left a permanent position to join Liberty as a contractor-a huge risk. I never believed in my abilities until I joined Liberty. Not only am I remunerated well for performing what I was contracted to do but I am hugely incentivised to overperform.
Liberty is built on trust. What you put in you will get out.
Without a doubt #thebestcompanytoworkfor
