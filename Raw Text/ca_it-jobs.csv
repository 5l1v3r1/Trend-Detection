Our developers work across the full stack of an application and understand that a project is not done until it has been deployed to production for our users. We want developers who can contribute positively to our culture and teach us things we didn't know before. Those same developers are always hungry to learn and improve in any way they can.Does this sound like a description of you? Read on, my friend...Things we’re looking for in terms of more specific skill-sets and experience: BS, MS, or PhD in Computer Science or related technical discipline (or equivalent).Extensive programming experience in a language that demands strong OO skills (C# / Java / C++ / etc.)Experience working with javascript frameworks in a complex web applicationExperience working with other scripting languages like PHP, Ruby, Python or Perl in a web application.Coding skills in Javascript / AJAX, database design and SQL. Several years of software design and development experience, with knowledge of Unix / Linux. Ideally you’ve been coding since you were old enough to read. A solid foundation in computer science, with strong competencies in data structures, algorithms, and software design.Previous experience with agile development methodologies and unit testing.How to ApplySend your resume to  devjobs@curvedental.com with the subject lineYour Name: Junior Full Stack Software Developer!or Your Name: Intermediate Full Stack Software Developer! as appropriate. Don’t forget to make the name substitution and to include the exclamation mark :)Don't just send us your standard cover letter; simply answer the following 3 questions:What do you know about our business and industry?Why is what we do important to our clients?What is your favourite aspect of our business, and why?This particular role is at Curve Dental's office in Calgary, Alberta, Canada.The Curve Dental StoryUnfortunately, we have only so many desks and so much capacity. Not everyone gets a chance to work at Curve. But, for the lucky few—the ones that have talent, the ones who can see beyond fossil fuels—these have the chance to work in an evolved and developer-focused culture.Our main product, Curve Hero, is a fully-featured web application that helps dental professionals manage and build a killer practice. We are the market leader, that one guy everyone wants to be. We believe in open-source and have a commitment to building quality code and awesome applications that push the envelope. If our developers are thinking outside the box, our customers are pushing the envelope in dentistry, too.Curve is growing, and stretching, and exploring, and shining a flashlight in the corners to see what’s out there, which all means we have interesting, challenging projects that are meaningful for the dental profession—projects that require the right kind of developer.Why You Want to Work HereZen Time. Quiet work environment with minimal meetings. Developers spend all but a few hours each week writing code.Me Time. Strong commitment to good work / life balance. Balanced engineers write better code.Smart Colleagues. Technically excellent team staffed by very knowledgeable and passionate developers. You can learn from great developers who are also keen to learn from you.Quality First. Commitment to building things the right way (i.e. project time dedicated to refactoring, strong unit testing culture, etc.).Immediate Gratification. Continuous Delivery means that code changes can take hours or days to hit production (rather than weeks or months)Testing. We have a QA department to make sure your code rocks as you intended it.Quality First, Again. Code reviews (that are both productive and educational) are baked into the process we use to ship code.Aerodynamic Processes. Solid product development process that is robust but doesn't get in the way of iterative development centred around minimal viable products; our process is continuously being tweaked and improved to make sure we are doing the right things at the right times.All Bases Covered. Full stack development from the database right through to the UI. Developers touch all parts of the codebase.Remote Flexibility. We do most of our work at the office (where the best collaboration happens), but we are able to work remotely, too, which makes life easier at times.Food and Beverage. We bring in lunch once a week; we keep a cooler stocked with your favourite beverages.
